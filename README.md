### ZeroCache — TxFee-less Wallet

> HODL • SPEDN • STAEK

__[ZeroCache](https://github.com/d14na/zerocached)__ is an integral component of, and has been fully integrated with the existing Zeronet economy, which serves over 10,000+ unique customers each month.

Our __ZeroCache Relayers__ are already running 24x7x365, for __EVERY__ ERC-20 HODLer to transfer their tokens _(and collectibles too)_ __WITHOUT__ spending ETH on gas fees.

__You're welcome!! o(~_^)o__

### 0PEN — Zero Private Enterprise Network

The first un-censorable virtual private network (VPN) built exclusively for use on the Zeronet. This network will NOT have access to ANY Clearnet *(ie insecure Internet)* systems. For this reason, we are confident in our ability to adequately scale the network's infrastructure as the use of zites continues to grow.

### Monetii — Sponsors & Affiliates Network

Advertisers will be able to expand their reach proportionally to their stake. Terms of Use violations *(outlined and governed by the community)* will result in a loss of 0GOLD *(an amount proportional to the severity of the violation).*

### Minado — Casual Mining Game

STAEK some ZeroGold to to mine in ANY of the more than a dozen mines within our community. Mining will be simulated *(through gamification)*, and used to promote Zeronet Explorer *(and the casual, everyday use of DApps & LApps)* to the non-crypto community.
