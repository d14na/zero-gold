# ZeroGold (Whitepaper)

**ZeroGold (0̸GOLD) is the "official" token of the [Zer0̸net](https://zer0net.com) and [Zeronet Explorer](https://zeronetexplorer.com).**

> We're building the Zer0̸net to deliver you greater information freedom, identity protection and data privacy than the Internet, without the creepy funk of the Darkweb. You're welcome!

## TL;DR

1. Never, ever, ever tell anyone how much **`0̸GOLD`** you're hodling.
2. Identical to Bitcoin, **`0̸GOLD`** is capped at 21 million bricks.
3. Unlike Bitcoin, **`0̸GOLD`** hodling is encouraged with premium subscriptions and rewards.
