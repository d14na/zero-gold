# ZeroGold (Whitepaper)

**Crypto's #1 HODLRE Coin — Official Community Token of the [Zer0̸net](https://zer0net.com) and [Zeronet Explorer](https://zeronetexplorer.com).**

### https://ZeroGold.Info

> ZeroGold was designed with the spirit of Bitcoin's infamous **HODL** Community. However, unlike a Bitcoin HODLRE, there are very clear incentives in becoming a **0̸GOLD HODLRE.**  

## TL;DR

ZeroGold empowers you to take FULL advantage of ALL the **Premium Features & Services** available throughout the growing Zer0̸net community **WITHOUT** having to spend even a single speck of **precious ZeroGold dust** to do it.

> **RULE #1:** NEVER let ANYONE know how much you're HODLing; spouse, kids, father Michael, trust **NO ONE!!**

## Planned/Proposed 21M 0̸GOLD Distribution

*• distribution is **highly** subject to change •*

    ➤ 10,500,000 — Token Mining
    ➤  2,500,000 — Zer0net Development
    ➤  2,000,000 — ZeroCharity
    ➤  1,000,000 — OG ZeroNet's Reddit Community
    ➤  1,000,000 — Rainy Day Fund (unforeseen circumstances)
    ➤  1,000,000 — BitcoinTalk's Community
    ➤  1,000,000 — Diana's Choice (strategic partners, influencers, etc)
    ➤    500,000 — Twitter's Community
    ➤    500,000 — Telegram's Community
    ➤    500,000 — Other Decentralized Networks
    ➤    500,000 — Undetermined

> **Staking your 0̸GOLD in return for utility tokens** used to engage with the Zer0̸net's growing list of premium features and services will be the primary use-case for the average HODLRE.

## Planned/Proposed Initial Staking Services

    ➤ Minado — ZeroGold Mining
    ➤    0̸PN — Zero Private Network
    ➤   0̸Ads — Zero Advertising

### Minado — ZeroGold Mining

HODLREs will be able to mine for ZeroGold in ANY of the more than a dozen ZeroGold mines within our community. Mining will be simulated *(through gamification)*, and used to promote Zeronet Explorer *(and the casual, everyday use of DApps & LApps)* to the non-crypto community.

### 0̸PN — Zero Private Network

The first un-censorable virtual private network (VPN) built exclusively for use on the Zer0net. This network will NOT have access to ANY Clearnet *(ie insecure Internet)* systems. For this reason, we are confident in our ability to adequately scale the network's infrastructure as the use of zites continues to grow.

### 0̸Ads — Zero Advertising

Advertisers will be able to expand their reach proportionally to their stake. Terms of Use violations *(outlined and governed by the community)* will result in a loss of 0̸GOLD *(an amount proportional to the severity of the violation).*
